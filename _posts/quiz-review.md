# Quiz Review
### Outcomes

- Conceptual Clarity
- Metacognition

### Description

Quizzes are not just assessment tools—they can be powerful learning experiences when approached reflectively. In this module, students will analyse their quiz performance by engaging in a structured review process with the help of AI. By revisiting incorrect answers and identifying misconceptions, students **reinforce correct concepts** and **strengthen problem-solving skills**.

### Activity Flow

- Self-Directed Learning with AI
    
    Provide the following instructions to the students.
    
    1. Revisit the quiz. For every wrong answer, converse with AI to find out both the correct answer and where you went wrong. Note down these details:
        1. What was the error?
        2. What was the **gap or misconception** that led to this error?
    2. At the end, write down **the concepts that need to be learned or revised**.
    3. What is your **plan of action** to improve in the next quiz?
- Debrief
    
    After completing the quiz review, students will be placed into small groups and participate in a short debrief session.
    
    1. Share one key misconception they discovered during their review and how they corrected it.
    2. Present their **action plan for improvement**.
    3. Receive peer feedback on their action plan:
        - Is it specific enough?
        - Does it address the core issues identified?
