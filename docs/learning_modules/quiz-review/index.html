<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Quizzes are not just assessment tools—they can be powerful learning experiences when approached reflectively. In this module, students will analyse their quiz performance by engaging in a structured review process with the help of AI. By revisiting incorrect answers and identifying misconceptions, students <strong>reinforce correct concepts</strong> and <strong>strengthen problem-solving skills</strong>.</p>

<p>Self-Directed Learning with AI</p>
<p>Provide the following instructions to the students.</p>

<li>What was the error?</li>
<li>What was the <strong>gap or misconception</strong> that led to this error?</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>At the end, write down <strong>the concepts that need to be learned or revised</strong>.</li>
<li>What is your <strong>plan of action</strong> to improve in the next quiz?</li>
